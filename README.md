Dynamic Spectrum Management plays a vital role in optimizing the frequency band utilization in cognitive radio networks. This paper presents the comparative analysis of different machine learning techniques-CNN, SVM, and RF-along with various modulation techniques like BPSK, GFSK, 8PSK, PAM4, QAM16, and QAM64 at a wide range of Signal-to-Noise Ratios. The results depict that CNN with GFSK modulation yields the highest accuracy and proves to be robust and reliable in varying noise conditions. This study gives insight into the best combinations of machine learning methods and modulation techniques for better spectral efficiency in cognitive radio networks.

This project consist of classifying wireless signals based on modulation type and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using Convolution Neural Network CNN , Support Vector Machine SVM and Random Forest RF . It processes signal data into a labeled format and prepares it for use in a model to identify the modulation type from the given signal characteristics. Thus, aimed to provide a comparative analysis based on the improvement in signal classification accuracy of 98.9% (CNN) , 96.98%(SVM) , 96.33% (RF) for better spectrum sensing.

The data set used for the project is RADIOML 2016.04C https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets/
