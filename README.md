# Spectrum-Sensing-using-CNN
Classifying wireless signals based on modulation type and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using Convolution Neural Network CNN. It processes signal data into a labeled format and prepares it for use in a model to identify the modulation type from the given signal characteristics. Thus, aimed to improve signal classification accuracy of 87% for better spectrum management.
